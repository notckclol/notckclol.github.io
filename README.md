This is my website. It is not fun at all. Below is how to use the ctz api. Also I didn't copy this from ckclol. 

# CTZ (CKCTIMEZONE)
This timezone is all about ckc. Here is how to do it.
# API
at your html you can put this.
`<script src="https://spmc.ml/clock/time.js"></script>`
# Second method
download from the link (or ctrl c + v) and put it there. In js put this `import {ctz} from "./time.js"`
